You can choose to feature a hero image on the home page by adding the path to the image. Specifying `bgislight` sets the corresponding contrasting font color for the text, i.e. `true` means dark font color will be used.

```toml
[params.hero]
  background = "img/hero-background-dark.jpeg"
  bgislight = false
```
