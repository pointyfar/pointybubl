The widgets section contain draggable elements that you can use to configure how you want the site to look. 

There are two main element types:

### Containers

These are used to create the layout. Containers may contain other containers and widgets. These are grouped under **sections**.

You may optionally configure a container to have a class applied to it.

You may move containers around using the hand icon as handle. Dragging and dropping them outside the drag area removes them.

### Widgets

Once you are happy with the layout, you can add the widgets to the containers they need to go into.
