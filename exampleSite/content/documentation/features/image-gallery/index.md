If you have your pages organised as page bundles, you can set 

```
show_gallery: true
```
on a post's front matter. This will display a gallery of all the resources it finds of type `image`.

![Image Gallery](https://github.com/pointyfar/pointybubl/raw/master/images/screenshot-gallery.png) 

It will use the `.Title` attribute as caption if set.
